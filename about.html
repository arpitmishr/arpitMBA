            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated and forward-thinking professional with a strong foundation in finance, complemented by a keen interest and growing expertise in digital marketing. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Business Administration from the College of Engineering Roorkee, where I graduated with a 9.02/10 CGPA and was recognized on the Director's List for being in the top 10% of my class. I am currently enhancing my knowledge and skills by pursuing a Master of Business Administration at Uttaranchal University.</p>
            <p>My passion lies in the intersection of finance and technology, particularly in how digital innovations can reshape the financial landscape. I am an avid learner and a proactive individual, always seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. My interests extend to writing educational blogs and researching innovative business models, which allows me to stay at the forefront of industry trends.</p>
